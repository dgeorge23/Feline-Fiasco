"""
python Feline-Fiasco.py

##Introduction to the program, including:

##What is its purpose
The program, titled "Feline Fiasco," is an interactive text-based game developed using Pygame. Its purpose is to lead the player through a thrilling adventure of escaping a pet store and guiding the protagonist, Miso, to find a happy ending while avoiding potential dangers.
##If it's a game, what is its goal and rules
The goal of the game is to help Miso make choices and navigate through various scenarios to achieve a successful escape from the pet store and search for a new life. Players interact with the game by using the number keys (1, 2, 3) to select different options and progress through the story. The choices they make will determine the outcome of the story.
##How to "install" or set up your codeï¼Ÿ
To "install" or set up the program, users need to download the code from a GitHub repository or obtain the necessary Python script files. They should ensure they have Python and the required dependencies (such as Pygame and moviepy) installed on their computer before running the program.
##How to interact with the program - what inputs will it expect? 
The program is a text-based interactive game. Users will read the narrative presented on the screen and encounter multiple decision points. At these decision points, the program will prompt users to make a choice by pressing the corresponding number keys (1, 2, or 3) to select from the available options.
##What outputs should users look for?
The outputs users should look for are:
1. The displayed narrative describing the current situation and choices available.
2. Options for making decisions presented with corresponding number keys.
3. The result of their chosen option, leading to a new narrative and potential branching paths.
4. Display of images and GIFs that help illustrate the story's context and atmosphere.
##Is it possible for anything to go wrong from the user's point of view? If so, what should they do about it
From the user's point of view, there might be a few things that could go wrong:
1. Unresponsive Game: If the game becomes unresponsive, the user can try pressing the number keys again or check if the program is still running correctly.
2. Missing Images or GIFs: If the program cannot find or load an image or GIF, it may show an error or a blank screen. Users should ensure that all necessary image and GIF files are present and correctly named.
3. Crashes or Errors: If the program crashes or encounters errors, users can try restarting the program. If the issue persists, they can check for any missing dependencies or ensure they are using the correct Python version.
4. Infinite Loops: In some rare cases, a bug in the code could lead to an infinite loop or an unintended state. If users suspect this issue, they should restart the game and avoid making the same choices that caused the loop.
5. Text Not Visible: If text is not visible alongside GIFs, users can check if there is an issue with the GIF files or if they are obstructing the text. They can also try resizing the window to see if it helps.
